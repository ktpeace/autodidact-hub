## Planned Features

- It will have learning categories and subcategories, like Humanities -> History.
- Users can vote on resources. Most-voted will be listed first.
- Users can comment on resources, and there will be a free-topic forum or Discord.
- User profiles will have badges for their learning at the smallest level (such as Humanities -> Languages -> Korean).
- Profiles will therefore be a summary of all knowledge/skills people possess. Users can download a summary of their skills as an image or PDF to share with others outside the site.
- Profiles will also have a radar graph drawn from the number of badges and the badge level in each top category.
